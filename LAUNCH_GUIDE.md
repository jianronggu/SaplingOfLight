## 🔧 Edit & See Changes Instantly

When you edit files in the `app/` folder, your browser **automatically reloads** (hot reload).

Examples:
- Edit `app/layout.tsx` → changes appear instantly
- Edit `app/components/ArtGalleryScene.tsx` → 3D viewer updates
- Edit `app/globals.css` → styles refresh immediately

Just **save the file** and look at your browser!

---

## 📦 Adding Your Own 3D Model

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Model**
Get a `.glb` file (Three.js format)

Common sources:
- Sketchfab.com (download as .glb)
- Blender (export as .glb)
- Your own 3D artist

### **Step 2: Place the File**
Copy your `.glb` file to:
```
public/models/your-model-name.glb
```

Example:
```
public/models/my-sculpture.glb
public/models/digital-art.glb
```

### **Step 3: Use It in Gallery**
Edit `app/(scenes)/gallery/page.tsx`:

```tsx
<ArtGalleryScene
  title="My Artwork Title"
  description="Beautiful description here"
  modelPath="/models/your-model-name.glb"
/>
```

That's it! Your model will load and display.

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### **Change the Title/Subtitle**
Edit `app/(scenes)/gallery/page.tsx`:
```tsx
<ArtGalleryScene

  description="New description here"
/>
```

### **Change Colors**
Edit `app/(scenes)/gallery/page.tsx`:
```tsx
<ArtGalleryScene
  accentColor="#ff1493"  // Bold pink
/>
```

### **Change Control Constraints**
Edit `app/components/ArtGalleryScene.tsx`:
```tsx
<OrbitControls
  minPolarAngle={Math.PI * 0.2}  // Allow more rotation
  maxPolarAngle={Math.PI * 0.8}
/>
```

### **Change Overlay Timing**
Edit `app/components/GalleryOverlay.tsx`:
```tsx
setTimeout(() => setIsVisible(false), 8000);  // Show longer (8 sec)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Cannot find module" error**
→ The module wasn't installed. Run:
```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### **Port 3000 already in use**
→ Another app is using it. Kill it:
```powershell
netstat -ano | Select-String "3000"
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
Then restart: `npm run dev`

### **Blank page or no 3D canvas**
→ Check browser console:
1. Open DevTools: **F12** or **Right-click → Inspect**
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for red errors
4. Share errors with me and I'll help fix

### **Model won't load**
→ Check:
1. File exists at `public/models/your-file.glb` ✓
2. Filename matches exactly (case-sensitive) ✓
3. File is not corrupted (try opening in Babylon Sandbox) ✓
4. Console shows no errors (F12) ✓
